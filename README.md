**ICP_1.ipynb**:
     **Program1**:Giving “Python” as a list of characters from console as input , delete the 2 characters, reverse the
                  resultant string and print it.
                  – Giving two numbers as input and performing arithmeticoperations(addition,substraction,multiplication,divison)
    **Program2** : accepts a sentenceas input  and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’.
    **Program 3** :Displaying letter grade based on an input classscore.

**ICP_2.ipynb**:
     **Program1**: program takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to
                    fullname function that will return the (full name).
                  –  function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string.
    **Program2** : program store the data in input.txt file and find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then 
                    print the output.
    **Program 3** : program reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a 
                    separate list using Nested Interactive loop and List comprehensions.
